# Bubble Sort!

Simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. If you've ever played card games you are familiar with this algorithms without even knowing about it.
It is the same way we sort cards from the lowest to the highest.
Simplest way to understand is to watch this quick video.

# Conclusion
Bubble sort is in place sorting algorithm.
It's time complexity in every case is O(n*n).
As we all see the bubble sort algorithm is not the fastest one but we can make a little change and improve it's performance by checking if in nested loop swap were called, if not w can break the loop because it is already sorted.
With this simple trick we can get to the point when Bubble Sort can sort with 
O(n) time complexity in the best case but we still get O(n*n) in the average and worst case. 
Feel free to download the code and try, but I suggest you to implement it by yourself
